## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

The most common sentiment that I obseved in our sample was a negative sentiment.

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

The reliability of the labels can change. It may be susceptible to errors or incorrect predictions. The large language model can try to describe the user's reviews as closely as possible accurately. Ultimately, the model can have AI hallucinations occurring which can result in patterns or information that is not necessarily there which can create inaccurate outputs. 


## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

As we noted earlier, the most common sentiment of Zico Coconut Water was negative. My recommendations are to improve upon the taste of the water, take a look at the pricing and design of the product, and conduct some focus groups to determine the reputation and changes to the product. The business should use this information to make an informed observation about what needs to be changed about the product. Based on the model, we can that negative reviews outnumber the positive reviews in the sample of 50 reviews.
