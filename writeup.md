## Question 1

What is the most common sentiment observed in your sample of 50 reviews according to your OpenAI labeled data?

According to the Reviews Analysis Bar Graph, the most common sentiment observed for Zico water was negative, with 35 reviews. We have a sample set of 50 reviews in our data set based on my OpenAI-labeled data. We can see that 70% of the reviews for Zico Water were negative sentiments. 

## Question 2

How reliable do you believe these labels are? Look at the respective labels OpenAI has generated for specific reviews, does it seem like the large language model accurately described the user's review? What risk do model hallucinations introduce into this analysis?

We utilzed an OpenAI labled data prompt to provided the respective labels for positive, negative, neutral and irrelevant sentiments. After the initial prompt, the data that was being returned was not accurate to our sample of 50 reviws. The first bar graph done should over 60 reviews for the product, which was over the sample of 50 reviews that we had.With that said, The reliability of the labels can change. It is important to have accurate system prompting to ensure that the respective labels that OpenAI has can be generated for a speficic review. For example, my intial prompt was very limited and I did not specify my sample of 50 reviews in my quotes. This prompted the information to be mislabled suggessting that we had more reviews than our sample set. The labels are more suspectible to errors occuring or incorrect predictions, esepcially if you just have generalized information. 

The large language model can try to describe the user's reviews as closely as possible accurately. It is important to provide helpeful examples, so that the output can be closer to your expect output.
However, the model can have AI hallucinations occurring which can result in patterns or information that is not necessarily there which can create inaccurate outputs. 


## Question 3

Using the most common sentiment, what would you recommend to this Coconut Water producer to improve customer satisfaction? Should they continue to pursue current market/product outcomes, or does there exist an opportunity for this business to improve its product?

Based on our bar graph, the most common sentiment of Zico Water was negative, with 35 reviews. According to the data that we have, we can infer that there is dissatisfaction with the product. 70% of the customers for product have negative response to the water,while 22% of the reviews were postive. 

My recommendation for the product is to look at what the common negative sentiments are for the product. It would be important to conduct more analysis of the common themes that are occuring in the negative and positive reviews. For example, if the taste of the water is the most common negative review, they can work on improving the taste or modifying the receipt. 

Overall, the dataset has 50 reviews. This provides us a more robut sample size that follows the Central Limit Theorom. Based on the model, we can that negative reviews overhemiligy outnumber the positive reviews in the sample of 50 reviews by 35 reviews. The postive reviews only accounts for 22% of the data.
